                <p>Steam Fiber was born from inspiration. Someone I had connected with at the time made an awesome 3D visualization site for a streaming service. Being inspired, I wanted to make my own 3D site, 
                    which led to me learning <span>Three.js</span> for the first time.</p>
                <p>Not only was I learning Three.js for the first time, but I was also learning <span>Next.js</span> for the first time. Considering my goals of improving as a Web developer and the need for a backend to communicate with 
                    Steam's Web <span>API</span>, leveling up and learning a framework was a reasonable choice. </p>
                <p>I got a recommendation to add some shareability to the site. This led me to Supabase's <span>PostgreSQL</span> service. The support for anonymous users was a great feature,
                    allowing any visitor to create a map, and generate a shareable link. 
                </p>
                <p>To give each particle (which represents a steam user in your network) some style, I used a color wheel to decide on a particle's color, and used some basic <span>GLSL</span> code to give them some life.</p>
                
                <h2><span>Future Work</span></h2>
                <p>I like the current state of SteamFiber and would most likely return to the project to ramp up the features. Something along the lines of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating more GLSL Code & a basic editor for users to experiment and try to make some themselves.</li>
                    <li>Theatre Mode: A basic timeline editor where the camera would traverse on the user's timed coordinates.</li>
                    <li>A Vault for registered users to save maps.</li>
                    <li>Allow for dynamic placement of particles.</li>
                </ul>
